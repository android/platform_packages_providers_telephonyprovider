      "message": "Sorry, I had the old bug in the updated commit message. Chen fixed this in patch set 5, 186542894 was created as a new Bug to separate the carrier id problem from the generic problem. Yes this CL is still needed, we see several carriers in Japan that get this bug.",

      "message": "the previous assumption is returning 3 digit by default if neither are valid because 3 digits are more commonly used.\n\nafter the change, if neither are valid then we are more likely to return 2 digit instead. returning 3 digit is completely determined by COUNTRY_MCC_WITH_THREE_DIGIT_MNC which non-complete.\n\nI think we should 1) build COUNTRY_MCC_WITH_TWO_DIGIT_MNC instead or 2) have complete THREE_DIGIT_MNC list or 3) upload missing JP mccmnc with two digit mnc with carrier informations. we can try to get them merged to the carrier id list.",

      "message": "A 3 digit MNC country code is much less common than a two digit one so default should be a 2 digit one. If I check my internal APN list I get 24 country codes with a three digit network code out of 209 country codes in total.\n\nReason the list was not complete from the start was there were some 3 digit MNC country codes that had both 2 and 3 digit MNCs in the APN list that made me confused. Examples were Bermuda, Barbados, Cayman Islands etc,  but I now realize that those can be fixed in the RRO apn so I will update the list to a complete one.",
