As far as I know only a rooted device or an OTA which contained a bad apns-conf.xml could contain a malformed file. And adding this code will only make it more likely that the problem will be undetected.\n\nI could see a solution where a dialog or notification was added to this code, but that seems like more effort than its worth. Can you present a case where this would help a normal user?",
